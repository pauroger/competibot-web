                </h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                At competibot ("we", "us", "our"), the privacy and security of
                our users ("you") are of paramount importance. This Data Privacy
                Policy explains what we collect, why we collect it, and how we
                use and protect it for our integrations on Slack and Discord.
            </p>
            <p>
                By using competibot, you agree to the collection and use of
                information in accordance with this policy.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Data We Collect</h3>
            <p>We only store the minimum data necessary to operate competibot on
            Slack and Discord:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Match data: results, standings, and player aliases/pseudonyms supplied via commands.</li>
                <li>Platform identifiers: workspace/server (guild) ID, channel ID, and user ID necessary to function.</li>
                <li>Command metadata: timestamps and parameters you submit to the bot (not broader message history).</li>
                <li>Operational logs: limited error and performance logs to keep the service reliable and secure.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not sell personal data. We do not read general messages; we only process the commands you invoke and the data you provide to the bot.</p>

            <h3>Legal Bases for Processing</h3>
            <p>Depending on your location, we process data based on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Performance of a contract: to provide the bot’s functionality you requested.</li>
                <li>Legitimate interests: to maintain, secure, and improve the service.</li>
                <li>Consent: where required and obtained via installation or continued use.</li>
                <li>Compliance with legal obligations: when we must respond to valid legal requests.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Sharing</h3>
            <p>
                We share data only with: (a) our service providers acting on our
                instructions (e.g., hosting), (b) Slack and Discord as separate
                platforms you choose to use, and (c) authorities when legally
                required. We require processors to protect data and not use it
                for their own purposes.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>
                The security of your personal information is important to us,
                but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet,
                or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive
                to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
                information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Your Rights</h3>
            <p>
                Depending on your location, you may have rights to request
                access, correction, deletion, restriction, or portability of
                your personal data. You can exercise these rights via the
                request methods below.
            </p>

            <h3>Platform Controls & Admin</h3>
            <p>
                Workspace and server administrators control app installation and
                removal on Slack and Discord. Removing the app will stop future
                data collection. Existing historical match data is retained
                unless you request deletion as described below.
            </p>

            <h3>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy is effective as of 2023-11-05 and will
                remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its
                provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately
                after being posted on this page.
            </p>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at
                any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically.
                Your continued use of the service after we post any
                modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page will constitute
                your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to
                abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.

            </header>
            <p>
                To initiate the process of data deletion, please submit your request through our dedicated <a href="https://pauroger.github.io/competibot-web/" target="_blank">Google Form</a> located on the main page. Be sure to include the exact name and ID of your Slack workspace or Discord server (guild) to help us locate your data accurately.

            <p>
                Alternatively, if your intention is solely to delete game records in a specific channel, execute the command <code>/delete_latest_game</code> as required.

            <p>
                We store match results, encompassing player aliases and the
                outcomes of matches, on an indefinite basis. This supports
                historical records and accurate skill level reporting.
            </p> 
            <p>
                We fully respect your right to privacy and data control.
                Removing the app from Slack or Discord stops future collection
                but does not automatically delete historical data. To remove
                existing data, please follow the steps in ‘Data Deletion
                Request’ above.
